### Pookalam Description
Brief description about your pookalam. What makes it special and different.
🌸 My Digital Pookalam

I created a digital Pookalam inspired by the traditional floral designs of Onam. It combines triangles, circles, diamonds, and custom flower images arranged in concentric rings to create a vibrant, layered floral pattern.

What Makes It Special:

Layered Design: The Pookalam has multiple rings — triangles, colored diamonds, and flowers — creating depth and symmetry.

Custom Flower Images: I used flower images in rings around circles, adding a realistic floral touch.

Interactive and Colorful: Colors alternate and patterns are designed to look visually appealing, giving a fun, festive vibe.

Creative Freedom: Unlike traditional Pookalams, this is digital, so you can tweak shapes, colors, and sizes easily.
